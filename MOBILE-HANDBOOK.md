Offboarding

Dear Quman, There has come a time when you continue your journey. We would like to thank you for your effort and contribution to our Q and we hope you will keep us in beautiful memories
We wish you a lot of business success and all the best!

For a detailed overview of the whole process please follow this link: Offboarding
Mobile Team specific steps:




# 


Make a mobile team sync meeting informing the rest of the team about the situation






- Make sure that all equipment is returned
- Delete user's Bitrise account from Q organisation
- Delete development email account from Q’s Apple Portal
- Delete account from Q’s GooglePay and Firebase services
- Change passwords for all admin accounts that were used by the offboarded developer and redistribute them via Zoho to developers that need them









## Testing new candidates


If HR decides that a new developer candidate has a potential to be a good fit for Q, Mobile Team Lead sends him/her a **coding assignment** to check his/her practical skills.


Every technology has its own assignment (Swift, Android or Flutter). Candidate has max of **10 days** to finish it.


For every candidate, we will create a temporary repository on **Q’s Github** account and invite him/her as a Developer. Assignment will be written in a **README** file under the main branch. Candidate will deliver the result via pull request on the main branch. This way Team Lead can easily see the changes in the code and ask additional questions by using **Comments** directly on the merged code.
